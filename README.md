Objectives
==========

Our goal for this project is to kick-off a new effort to bring better tooling to MongoDB in an all-in-one, portable, and easy to deploy package.

There are already a number of existing community-built projects and tools as well as tools for managing MongoDB that have been built by 10gen. We'd like to begin an effort to consolidate some of these tools together into one easily distributed package and develop a few new offerings to be included as well.

Here are a few things we'd eventually like to tackle:

* Database Visualizer
* Query Analyzer
* Log Explorer
* Database Explorer
* Enhanced Query Interface
* Document Editor
* REST API
* Notification & Alerts
